## Notes on Streetview implementation

The streetview implementation is a 2d maps api call that will use pins to track quest data. Quest data is stored in a Firebase DB, and should be cached in the user's phone every time the user travels some x distance (pins in radius y are cached as user travels distance x should be proportional). Need to figure out a way to put pins on 2D map.
